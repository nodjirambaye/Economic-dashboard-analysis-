# ðŸ“Š Economic Dashboard Analysis

An advanced Python-based data analysis project for visualizing and forecasting macroeconomic indicators.  
It combines **correlation analysis**, **rolling correlations**, **trend forecasting**, and **recession detection** in one clean dashboard.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Correlation Heatmap** â€” Static relationships between Inflation Rate, GDP Growth, and Interest Rate.
- **Rolling Correlation** â€” Tracks how these relationships change over time.
- **12-Month Forecasting** â€” Predicts future trends using linear regression (no external heavy libraries).
- **Recession Highlighting** â€” Shades periods of negative GDP growth.

## ðŸ“– Interpretation of Results
1. **Correlation Heatmap**
   - Values near `1.00` = strong positive relationship.
   - Values near `-1.00` = strong negative relationship.
   - Values near `0` = little or no relationship.
   
2. **Rolling Correlation**
   - Shows how relationships shift over time.
   - Example: Inflation and interest rates might be correlated during one period but not in another.

3. **Forecast**
   - Uses historical data to project 12 months ahead.
   - Red dashed lines indicate predicted values.

4. **Recession Zones**
   - Shaded gray areas = negative GDP growth periods.
